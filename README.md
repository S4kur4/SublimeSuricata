# SublimeSuricata

Forked from @justjamesnow: [SublimeSuricata](https://github.com/justjamesnow/SublimeSuricata).

## The difference

Due to the latest version of Suricata has changed the HTTP sticky buffer filed syntax (from `http_` to `http.`), so I changed the corresponding syntax to support these changes.
